A microclimatic study of global change in a desert ecosystem.


The hypothesis tested is that shrubs directly and indirectly buffer local changes in the microenvironment thereby functioning as refuges for other species within arid and semi-arid regions subject to dramatic global change drivers.  To examine this hypothesis for Santa Barbara County, the following predictions will be tested: (i) shrub micro-environments reduce the level of stress and amplitude of variation associated with temperature and moisture, (ii) many plant and animal species including threatened lizards are relatively more common with shrubs within the region, and (iii) the variation in the interaction patterns between species relates to the extent of amelioration provided by shrub-biodiversity complexes within the region.
